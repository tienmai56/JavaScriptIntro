    <h1>NTUC Hala Roasted Chicken</h1>
    <div>
        <p class="intro">NTUC chicken is a precooked type of chicken sold in FairPrice supermarket in various locations. FYI

        <div id="favorite">
        <p><li id="list">I like it so much because:</li>
            <ol class="favorite">
                <li>it's cheap: with around $5 you have a big ass chicken</li>
                <li>it's fast: took me only 5 mins to pick a well cooked chicken yey me</li>
                <li>it's protein rich: having to train 5 hours almost everyday I'm too lazy and don't have time nor energy
                    to properly plan my diet. 
                    But my coach recommended this NTUC chicken as he said it will provides me with enough energy to grind through my 
                    training session and stay full until evening. He's not wrong</li>
